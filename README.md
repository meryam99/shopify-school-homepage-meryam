üß™ What I‚Äôd improve with more time

A11y:

Full focus trap in the popup and return focus to opener.

Keyboard support for sliders (left/right), and for color/size groups (roving tabindex).

Performance:

Responsive images (<img srcset/sizes>), WebP/AVIF, lazy loading.

Preload hero fonts with font-display: swap.

Data layer:

Fetch product data from JSON/API instead of hardcoded objects.

Persist size/color selections.

Testing:

Unit tests with Vitest, e2e with Playwright.

Tooling:

GitHub Actions CI (lint, test, build).

husky + lint-staged pre-commit hooks.

i18n:

Extract copy into a messages file for multi-language support.

Design polish:

Motion (micro-interactions), skeleton loaders, better empty/error states.
